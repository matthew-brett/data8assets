## World Progress


In this project, you'll explore data from [Gapminder.org](http://gapminder.org), a website dedicated to providing a fact-based view of the world and how it has changed. That site includes several data visualizations and presentations, but also publishes the raw data that we will use in this project to recreate and extend some of their most famous visualizations.

The Gapminder website collects data from many sources and compiles them into tables that describe many countries around the world. All of the data they aggregate are published in the [Systema Globalis](https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/blob/master/README.md). Their goal is "to compile all public statistics; Social, Economic and Environmental; into a comparable total dataset." All data sets in this project are copied directly from the Systema Globalis without any changes.

This project is dedicated to [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) (1948-2017), who championed the use of data to understand and prioritize global development challenges.

### Logistics

**Deadline.** This project is due at 11:59pm on Thursday 2/23. You can earn an early submission bonus point by submitting your completed project by Wednesday 2/22. Late submissions will be accepted until Tuesday 2/28, but a 10% late penalty will be applied for each day late. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.

**Checkpoint.** For full credit, you must also complete the first 8 questions and submit them by 11:59pm on Friday 2/17. You will have some lab time to work on these questions, but we recommend that you start the project before lab and leave time to finish the checkpoint afterward.

**Partners.** You may work with one other partner. It's best to work with someone in your lab. Only one of you is required to submit the project. On [okpy.org](http://okpy.org), the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.

**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.

**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Piazza, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Piazza post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, email your TA or tutor for help. You can find contact information for the staff on the [course website](http://data8.org/sp17/staff.html).

**Tests.** Passing the tests for a question **does not** mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!

**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. 

To get started, load `datascience`, `numpy`, `plots`, and `ok`.

```{python}
from datascience import *
import numpy as np

# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plots
plots.style.use('fivethirtyeight')

from client.api.notebook import Notebook
ok = Notebook('project1.ok')
_ = ok.auth(inline=True)

## 1. Global Population Growth

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
The global population of humans reached 1 billion around 1800, 3 billion around 1960, and 7 billion around 2011. The potential impact of exponential population growth has concerned scientists, economists, and politicians alike.

The UN Population Division estimates that the world population will likely continue to grow throughout the 21st century, but at a slower rate, perhaps reaching 11 billion by 2100. However, the UN does not rule out scenarios of more extreme growth.

<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/08/scientists-more-worried-than-public-about-worlds-growing-population/ft_15-06-04_popcount/"> 
 <img src="pew_population_projection.png"/> 
</a>

In this section, we will examine some of the factors that influence population growth and how they are changing around the world.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
The first table we will consider is the total population of each country over time. Run the cell below.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}
# The population.csv file can also be found online here:
# https://github.com/open-numbers/ddf--gapminder--systema_globalis/raw/master/ddf--datapoints--population_total--by--geo--time.csv
# The version in this project was downloaded in February, 2017.
population = Table.read_table('population.csv')
population.show(3)
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
### Bangladesh

In the `population` table, the `geo` column contains three-letter codes established by the [International Organization for Standardization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization) (ISO) in the [Alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3#Current_codes) standard. We will begin by taking a close look at Bangladesh. Inspect the standard to find the 3-letter code for Bangladesh.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 1.** Create a table called `b_pop` that has two columns labeled `time` and `population_total`. The first column should contain the years from 1970 through 2015 (including both 1970 and 2015) and the second should contain the population of Bangladesh in each of those years.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=TRUE}
b_pop = ...
b_pop
```

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}
_ = ok.grade('q1_1')
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
Run the following cell to create a table called `b_five` that has the population of Bangladesh every five years. At a glance, it appears that the population of Bangladesh has been growing quickly indeed!
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}
b_pop.set_format('population_total', NumberFormatter)

fives = np.arange(1970, 2016, 5) # 1970, 1975, 1980, ...
b_five = b_pop.sort('time').where('time', are.contained_in(fives))
b_five
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 2.** Create a table called `b_five_growth` that includes three columns, `time`, `population_total`, and `annual_growth`. There should be one row for every five years from 1970 through 2010 (but not 2015). The first two columns are the same as `b_five`. The third column is the **annual** growth rate for each five-year period. For example, the annual growth rate for 1975 is the yearly exponential growth rate that describes the total growth from 1975 to 1980 when applied 5 times.

*Hint*: Only your `b_five_growth` table will be scored for correctness; the other names are suggestions that you are welcome to use, change, or delete.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=TRUE}
b_1970_through_2010 = ...
initial = ...
changed = ...
b_five_growth = ...
b_five_growth.set_format('annual_growth', PercentFormatter)
```

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}
_ = ok.grade('q1_2')
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
While the population has grown every five years since 1970, the annual growth rate decreased dramatically from 1985 to 2005. Let's look at some other information in order to develop a possible explanation. Run the next cell to load three additional tables of measurements about countries over time.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}
life_expectancy = Table.read_table('life_expectancy.csv')
child_mortality = Table.read_table('child_mortality.csv').relabeled(2, 'child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born')
fertility = Table.read_table('fertility.csv')
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
The `life_expectancy` table contains a statistic that is often used to measure how long people live, called *life expectancy at birth*. This number, for a country in a given year, [does not measure how long babies born in that year are expected to live](http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/what-does-life-expectancy-birth-really-mean). Instead, it measures how long someone would live, on average, if the *mortality conditions* in that year persisted throughout their lifetime. These "mortality conditions" describe what fraction of people at each age survived the year. So, it is a way of measuring the proportion of people that are staying alive, aggregated over different age groups in the population.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 3.** Perhaps population is growing more slowly because people aren't living as long. Use the `life_expectancy` table to draw a line graph with the years 1970 and later on the horizontal axis that shows how the *life expectancy at birth* has changed in Bangladesh.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=TRUE, manual_grade=TRUE, manual_problem_id=global_pop_3}
...
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 4.** Does the graph above help directly explain why the population growth rate decreased from 1985 to 2010 in Bangladesh? Why or why not? What happened in Bangladesh in 1991, and does that event explain the change in population growth rate?
<!-- #endregion -->

*Write your answer here, replacing this text.*
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
The `fertility` table contains a statistic that is often used to measure how many babies are being born, the *total fertility rate*. This number describes the [number of children a woman would have in her lifetime](https://www.measureevaluation.org/prh/rh_indicators/specific/fertility/total-fertility-rate), on average, if the current rates of birth by age of the mother persisted throughout her child bearing years, assuming she survived through age 49. 
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 5.** Write a function `fertility_over_time` that takes the Alpha-3 code of a `country` and a `start` year. It returns a two-column table with labels "`Year`" and "`Children per woman`" that can be used to generate a line chart of the country's fertility rate each year, starting at the `start` year. The plot should include the `start` year and all later years that appear in the `fertility` table. 

Then, in the next cell, call your `fertility_over_time` function on the Alpha-3 code for Bangladesh and the year 1970 in order to plot how Bangladesh's fertility rate has changed since 1970. **The expression that draws the line plot is provided for you; please don't change it.**

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
It has been observed that lower fertility rates are often associated with lower child mortality rates. The link has been attributed to family planning: if parents can expect that their children will all survive into adulthood, then they will choose to have fewer children. We can see if this association is evident in Bangladesh by plotting the relationship between total fertility rate and [child mortality rate per 1000 children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_mortality).
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 7.** Using both the `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables, draw a scatter diagram with one point for each year, starting with 1970, that has Bangladesh's total fertility on the horizontal axis and its child mortality on the vertical axis. 

**The expression that draws the scatter diagram is provided for you; please don't change it.** Instead, create a table called `fertility_and_child_mortality` with the appropriate column labels and data in order to generate the chart correctly. Use the label "`Children per woman`" to describe total fertility and the label "`Child deaths per 1000 born`" to describe child mortality.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=TRUE}
fertility_and_child_mortality = ...

### The World

The change observed in Bangladesh since 1970 can also be observed in many other developing countries: health services improve, life expectancy increases, and child mortality decreases. At the same time, the fertility rate often plummets, and so the population growth rate decreases despite increasing longevity.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
Run the cell below to generate two overlaid histograms, one for 1960 and one for 2010, that show the distributions of total fertility rates for these two years among all 201 countries in the `fertility` table.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 9.** Assign `fertility_statements` to a list of the numbers for each statement below that can be correctly inferred from these histograms.
1. About the same number of countries had a fertility rate between 3.5 and 4.5 in both 1960 and 2010.
1. In 2010, about 40% of countries had a fertility rate between 1.5 and 2.
1. In 1960, less than 20% of countries had a fertility rate below 3.
1. More countries had a fertility rate above 3 in 1960 than in 2010.
1. At least half of countries had a fertility rate between 5 and 8 in 1960.
1. At least half of countries had a fertility rate below 3 in 2010.

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=TRUE, manual_grade=TRUE, manual_problem_id=global_pop_10}
...
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 11.** Create a function `stats_for_year` that takes a `year` and returns a table of statistics. The table it returns should have four columns: `geo`, `population_total`, `children_per_woman_total_fertility`, and `child_mortality_under_5_per_1000_born`. Each row should contain one Alpha-3 country code and three statistics: population, fertility rate, and child mortality for that `year` from the `population`, `fertility` and `child_mortality` tables. Only include rows for which all three statistics are available for the country and year.

In addition, restrict the result to country codes that appears in `big_50`, an array of the 50 most populous countries in 2010. This restriction will speed up computations later in the project.

*Hint*: The tests for this question are quite comprehensive, so if you pass the tests, your function is probably correct. However, without calling your function yourself and looking at the output, it will be very difficult to understand any problems you have, so try your best to write the function correctly and check that it works before you rely on the `ok` tests to confirm your work.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=TRUE}
# We first create a population table that only includes the 
# 50 countries with the largest 2010 populations. We focus on 
# these 50 countries only so that plotting later will run faster.

<!-- #region {"deletable": true, "editable": true} -->
**Question 12.** Create a table called `pop_by_decade` with two columns called `decade` and `population`. It has a row for each `year` since 1960 that starts a decade. The `population` column contains the total population of all countries included in the result of `stats_for_year(year)` for the first `year` of the decade. For example, 1960 is the first year of the 1960's decade. You should see that these countries contain most of the world's population.

*Hint:* One approach is to define a function `pop_for_year` that computes this total population, then `apply` it to the `decade` column. 
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=TRUE}

The `countries` table describes various characteristics of countries. The `country` column contains the same codes as the `geo` column in each of the other data tables (`population`, `fertility`, and `child_mortality`).

**Question 13.** Create a table called `region_counts` that has two columns, `region` and `count`. It should describe the count of how many countries in each region appear in the result of `stats_for_year(1960)`. For example, one row would have `south_asia` as its `world_6region` value and an integer as its `count` value: the number of large South Asian countries for which we have population, fertility, and child mortality numbers from 1960.

You'll find that the great divide between so-called "Western" and "developing" countries that existed in the 1960's has nearly disappeared. This shift in fertility rates is the reason that the global population is expected to grow more slowly in the 21st century than it did in the 19th and 20th centuries.

## 2. Global Poverty

<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
In 1800, 85% of the world's 1 billion people lived in *extreme poverty*, defined by the United Nations as "a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, shelter, education and information." A common measure of extreme poverty is a person living on less than \$1.25 per day.

In 2015, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty was estimated to be 12%. Although the world rate of extreme poverty has declined consistently for hundreds of years, the number of people living in extreme poverty is still close to 1 billion. The United Nations recently adopted an [ambitious goal](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/poverty/): "By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere."
In this section, we will examine extreme poverty trends around the world.
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
First, load the population and poverty rate by country and year and the country descriptions. While the `population` table has values for every recent year for many countries, the `poverty` table only includes certain years for each country in which a measurement of the rate of extreme poverty was available.
<!-- #endregion -->

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}
population = Table.read_table('population.csv')
countries = Table.read_table('countries.csv').where('country', are.contained_in(population.group('geo').column(0)))
poverty = Table.read_table('poverty.csv')
poverty.show(3)
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 1.** Assign `latest` to a three-column table with one row for each country that appears in the `poverty` table. The first column should contain the 3-letter code for the country. The second column should contain the *most recent year* for which an extreme poverty rate is available for the country. The third column should contain the poverty rate in that year. **Do not change the last line, so that the labels of your table are set correctly.**

*Hint*: the `first` function may be helpful, but you are not required to use it.

```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 2.** Using both `latest` and `population`, create a four-column table called `recent` with one row for each country in `latest`. The four columns should have the following labels and contents:
1. `geo` contains the 3-letter country code,
1. `poverty_percent` contains the most recent poverty percent,
1. `population_total` contains the population of the country in 2010,
1. `poverty_total` contains the number of people in poverty **rounded to the nearest integer**, based on the 2010 population and most recent poverty rate.

**Question 3.** Assuming that the `poverty_total` numbers in the `recent` table describe *all* people in 2010 living in extreme poverty, assign the name `poverty_percent` to the percentage of the world's 2010 population that were living in extreme poverty. You should find a number that is somewhat above the 2015 global estimate of 12%, since many country-specific poverty rates are older than 2015.

*Hint*: The sum of the `population_total` column in the `recent` table is not the world population, because only a subset of the world's countries have known poverty rates. Use the `population` table to compute the world's 2010 total population.

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}
countries.select('country', 'name', 'world_4region', 'latitude', 'longitude')
```

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
**Question 4.** Using both `countries` and `recent`, create a five-column table called `poverty_map` with one row for every country in `recent`.  The four columns should have the following labels and contents:
1. `latitude` contains the country's latitude,
1. `longitude` contains the country's longitude,
1. `name` contains the country's name,
1. `region` contains the country's region from the `world_4region` column of `countries`,
1. `poverty_total` contains the country's poverty total.

Although people live in extreme poverty throughout the world (with more than 5 million in the United States), the largest numbers are in Asia and Africa.

**Question 5.** Assign `largest` to a two-column table with the `name` (not the 3-letter code) and `poverty_total` of the 10 countries with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty.

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=TRUE}

**Question 6.** Write a function called `poverty_timeline` that takes the name of a country as its argument. It should draw a line plot of the number of people living in poverty in that country with time on the horizontal axis. The line plot should have a point for each row in the `poverty` table for that country. To compute the population living in poverty from a poverty percentage, multiply by the population of the country **in that year**.

*Hint*: The names within the `poverty_timeline` function correspond to our staff solution, but you don't need to use them. Any way that you want to draw the plot is fine, as long as it generates the correct graph.

def population_for_country_in_year(row_of_poverty_table):

    of a country in a year using a row from the poverty table."""

    """Draw a timeline of people living in extreme poverty in a country."""

```{python deletable=FALSE, editable=FALSE}
poverty_timeline('China')

<!-- #region {"deletable": false, "editable": false} -->
Although the number of people living in extreme poverty has been increasing in Nigeria and the United States, the massive decreases in China and India have shaped the overall trend that extreme poverty is decreasing worldwide, both in percentage and in absolute number.
