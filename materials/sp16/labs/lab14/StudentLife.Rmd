## StudentLife

This notebook loads the StudentLife data described in the Lab 12 handout.

```{python}
# Run this cell, but please don't change it.

# These lines import the Numpy and Datascience modules.
import numpy as np
from datascience import *

# These lines do some fancy plotting magic.
import matplotlib
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')
import warnings
warnings.simplefilter('ignore', FutureWarning)
```

### Data

Over the course of a semester, the Piazza usage of a 30-student class at Dartmouth College was recorded and released as part of the Student Life research project, which is [described online](http://studentlife.cs.dartmouth.edu/). 

Each row of the `students` table represents a student. In addition to the student's GPA, the row tallies 

* `days online`: The number of days on which the student viewed the online forum
* `views`: The number of posts viewed
* `contributions`: The number of contributions, including posts and follow-up discussions
* `questions`: The number of questions posted
* `notes`: The number of notes posted
* `answers`: The number of answers posted

```{python}
students = Table.read_table('grades_and_piazza.csv')
students
```

```{python}
students.where('GPA', are.above(3.1)).where('contributions', are.below(30)).scatter('GPA', 'contributions', fit_line=True)
```

```{python}
np.count_nonzero(students.column('answers'))
```
