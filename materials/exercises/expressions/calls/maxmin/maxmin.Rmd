## The Middle


Suppose that Yulin, another Data 8 student, is tasked with writing code to find the middle of three distinct numbers named `a`, `b`, and `c`. (By “middle” we mean the value that is neither the maximum nor the minimum.) For example, given the values 4, 2, and 7, the code should give back 4.

Yulin has a moment of inspired thought and rapidly types the following into her Jupyter notebook:

```{python}
a + b + c - max(a, b, c) + min(a, b, c)
```

Is her code correct?  Why or why not?  If not, make a *simple* change to the cell above to fix it.

*Hint:* Running the cell will produce an error because we haven't defined `a`, `b`, and `c`, but you're free to make any changes you want to test your ideas.  (Please have just 1 line in the cell above in the notebook you submit, though.)

```{python}
# Run this cell to submit your work *after* you have passed all of the test cells.
# It's ok to run this cell multiple times. Only your final submission will be scored.

# !TZ=America/Los_Angeles ipython nbconvert --output=".maxmin_$(date +%m%d_%H%M)_submission.html" maxmin.ipynb
```
