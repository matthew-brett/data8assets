## Ninety-Nine Bottles


Bored of singing the "ninety-nine bottles" song on a long car trip, Patrick tries to find as many Python expressions as he can that evaluate to 99. He doesn't have a laptop, and his Python is a little rusty. He first defines `x` as 10:

```{python}
x = 10
```

For each cell below, write `#CORRECT` next to the expression in the cell if it evaluates to 99.  Otherwise, rewrite the expression so that it does evaluate to 99.  To fix expressions, **you can only add operators, commas, and parentheses**.

To get the most out of this exercise, try to fix the expressions before running them.

```{python}
10 x - 1
```

```{python}
(x)(x) - 1
```

```{python}
11 * x - x + 1
```

```{python}
abs(x * x) - abs(9 - x)
```

```{python}
abs -99
```

```{python}
pow(x 2) - 1
```

```{python}
# Run this cell to submit your work *after* you have passed all of the test cells.
# It's ok to run this cell multiple times. Only your final submission will be scored.

# !TZ=America/Los_Angeles ipython nbconvert --output=".ninetynine_$(date +%m%d_%H%M)_submission.html" ninetynine.ipynb
```
