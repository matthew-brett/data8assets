## More Children Living at Home?


A USA Today [article](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-03-16-failure_x.htm) from 2006 includes this sentence: “Since 1970, the percentage of people ages 18 to 34 [in the United States] who live at home with their family increased 48%, from 12.5 million to 18.6 million, the Census Bureau says.”


**Question 1.** The word “percentage” isn’t used correctly in the context of the rest of the sentence. What word should replace it?
