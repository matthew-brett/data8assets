## Discussion: Classifying Songs by Lyrics


Today's discussion is designed to prepare you for Project 3.  In this project, you'll create a classifier that predicts a song's genre based on its lyrics (the words in the song).  Each observation is a song.  Every song's genre is either hip-hop or country.  There is one attribute for every word that's in any song.  A song's value for an attribute is the *proportion* of the song's lyrics that are that word.

In this discussion, we'll limit ourselves to just two attributes: the frequency of the word "truck" and the frequency of the word "style".  It's easiest to see this with a picture.

The hollow blue triangle labeled 7 represents one hip-hop song.  The graph says that song contains a few instances of the word "truck" - around 2% of its lyrics - and a few more instances of the world "style" - around 3%.

Whenever you build a classifier, it's important to have a separate dataset to test it on.  This is called a *test set*.  The hollow shapes represent songs in the test set, and the filled-in shapes represent songs in the training set.  The test set songs have been labeled with numbers.

**Question 1.** Suppose you train a 1-nearest neighbor classifier on the training set.  For each song in the test set, find its nearest neighbor and draw a line between them.  How will the classifier classify each song in the test set?  Which labels are correct?  (For convenience, we've written in the actual label of each song.)

<!-- #region {"for_assignment_type": "student"} -->
||1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|True label|c|c|c|c|c|c|h|h|h|h|
|Label|||||||||||
|Correct?|||||||||||
<!-- #endregion -->

**Question 2.** What percentage of the test set does the 1-nearest neighbor classifier get right?

<!-- #region {"for_assignment_type": "student"} -->
<br>
<!-- #endregion -->

**Question 3.** Draw the *decision boundaries* of the 1-nearest neighbor classifier in the top-left region of the graph (the region to the left and above song 4) and in the bottom-right region of the graph (around song 9).


**Question 4.** Suppose you train a **3-nearest neighbor** classifier on the training set.  For each song in the test set, find its next 2 nearest neighbors and draw a line to them.  How will the classifier classify each song in the test set?  Which labels are correct?  What proportion did we get right this time?

<!-- #region {"for_assignment_type": "student"} -->
||1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|True label|c|c|c|c|c|c|h|h|h|h|
|Label|||||||||||
|Correct?|||||||||||
<!-- #endregion -->

**Question 5.** Why would it be a bad idea to use a 19-nearest neighbor classifier with this dataset?

<!-- #region {"for_assignment_type": "student"} -->
