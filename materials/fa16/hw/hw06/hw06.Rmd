## 1. Catching Cheaters



Suppose you are a casino owner, and your casino runs a very simple game of chance.  The customer names heads or tails, and then a dealer flips a coin.  The customer wins \$9 from the casino if they guess the right side and loses \$10 if they're wrong.


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 1
Assuming no one is cheating and the coin is fair, if a customer bets once on heads, what is the chance they win that bet?  Over many bets on heads, what is the average amount of money the customer wins from a single bet?  Does your answer change if they bet on tails instead?


*Write your answer here, replacing this text.*


A certain customer plays the game 20 times, betting heads each time, and wins 13 of the bets.  You suspect that the customer is cheating!  That is, you think that their chance of winning could be something other than the normal chance of winning.

You decide to test this using the outcomes of the 20 games you observed.


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 2
Define the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis for this investigation.

<!-- #region {"for_assignment_type": "student"} -->
**Null hypothesis:** ...

**Alternative hypothesis:** ...
<!-- #endregion -->

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 3
Define a test statistic function named `test_statistic`.  Your function should take as its argument the number of times the customer won.  It should return the value of the test statistic for those data.  You'll have to decide how to define the test statistic.  **Then**, compute the value of your test statistic for the 20 games played by the customer we're investigating.  Call this number `actual_test_statistic`.

```{python for_assignment_type=student}
def test_statistic(num_wins):
    ...

actual_test_statistic = ...
actual_test_statistic
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 4
Write a function called `simulate_under_null`.  It should take no arguments.  It should return the number of wins in 20 games simulated under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.  (That number is random.)

```{python for_assignment_type=student}
def simulate_under_null():
    ...
```

```{python}
_ = tests.grade('q1_4')
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 5
Run your simulation 10,000 times and make a histogram of the test statistics.  (Be sure to pick bins that accurately portray the distribution.)

```{python for_assignment_type=student}
...
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 6
Compute a P-value for this test by looking at the histogram.  (Don't write code.  It's okay if your answer is off by a bit.)

```{python for_assignment_type=student}
p_value = ...
p_value
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 7
Suppose you use a P-value cutoff of 1%, according to the arbitrary conventions of hypothesis testing.  What do you conclude?


*Write your answer here, replacing this text.*


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 8
Is `p_value` the probability that the customer cheated, or the probability that the customer didn't cheat, or neither?


*Write your answer here, replacing this text.*


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 9
Is 1% (the P-value cutoff) the probability that the customer cheated, or the probability that the customer didn't cheat, or neither?


*Write your answer here, replacing this text.*


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 10
Is either `p_value` or 1% the probability of seeing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than this one if the null hypothesis were true?


*Write your answer here, replacing this text.*


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 11
Suppose you run this test for 400 different customers after observing each customer play 20 games.  When you reject the null hypothesis for a customer, you accuse that customer of cheating.  If no customer were actually cheating, how many would you expect to accuse, on average (if any)?  Explain your answer.

## 2. Pell Grants by State



The US National Center for Education Statistics compiles information about US colleges and universities in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).  Here's a [spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjMocT62pHOAhUJ1GMKHenBCccQFggeMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fnces.ed.gov%2Fipeds%2Ftablefiles%2FtableDocs%2FIPEDS201314Tablesdoc.xlsx&usg=AFQjCNGfg7FWu8NNIQ5ABCDoUH_Yu6Tm0A&sig2=K-z7Bvv2fQSkKSHeYLtkBg) describing the tables in the IPEDS.  The full datasets are available [here](http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx).

In this assignment, we'll use IPEDS data to compute the proportion of college students in each US state who receive Pell grants, which are a kind of financial aid.  The data come from 2013.

The data we need are spread across two IPEDS tables, so we'll have to use `join` to bring them together.

First, run the cell below to load the IPEDS data.  (We've pared down the data to just a few columns for this exercise, but the original datasets are quite rich.)

```{python}
sfa = Table.read_table("sfa.csv")
hd = Table.read_table("hd.csv")

sfa.show(5)
hd.show(5)
```

We want to compute the proportion of students in each *state* who receive Pell grants.  Right now we know:

* how many students are at each *school* (the `sfa` table);
* how many students received Pell grants at each school (also the `sfa` table); and
* what state each school is in (the `hd` table).

Let's work backward.  If we know the total number of students in each state and the total number of Pell grant recipients in each state, we can compute the proportions.  If we know how many students and Pell grant recipients were at each school, and we know what state each school is in, then we can group by state to compute the total number of students and Pell grant recipients per state.

That means we first need to compile the state, student, and Pell grant recipient information for each school into a single table.

To match data across tables, each school is assigned a unique identifier in the column named "Institution ID".


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 1
Make a table called `with_state` that includes one row for each school that's present in *both* `sfa` and `hd`.  Each row should have the school's ID, its number of undergraduate students, its number of Pell grant recipients, and its state.  (It's okay if it has other columns besides those four.)  Use the same names for those columns as the corresponding columns in the original data tables.

```{python}
with_state = ...
with_state
```

```{python}
_ = tests.grade('q2_1')
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 2
Make a table called `students_and_grants_by_state` that has the total number of undergraduates and Pell grant recipients in each *state*.  Use the same names for those columns as the corresponding columns in the original data tables.

```{python for_assignment_type=student}
students_and_grants_by_state = ...
students_and_grants_by_state
```

```{python}
_ = tests.grade('q2_2')
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 3
Create a table called `pell_proportions` with two columns: "State (abbreviated)" is the name of each state, and "Pell proportion" is the proportion of students in each state who receive Pell grants.

```{python}
pell_proportions = ...
pell_proportions
```

```{python}
_ = tests.grade('q2_3')
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 4
Make a histogram of Pell grant proportions.

```{python}
...
```

<!-- #region -->
The file `us.json` contains data about the boundaries of each US state.  We have loaded it as a map by calling `Map.read_geojson`.

*Note:* The data come from [NOAA](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/geodata/catalog/national/html/us_state.htm).  We converted them to this format using a tool called `ogr2ogr` (see [here](http://ben.balter.com/2013/06/26/how-to-convert-shapefiles-to-geojson-for-use-on-github/)) and used [mapshaper](http://www.mapshaper.org) to reduce the resolution to 1% of the original.


The Map method `color` colors regions in a map according to numbers you specify.  It takes 2 arguments:

1. A table whose first column names each region, and whose second column gives the intensity of the color you want for that region.
2. The named argument `key_on=...`, where the argument itself is a string that tells `color` how you're identifying each region.  In this case, both `pell_proportions` and the map know about each state's abbreviation, so use `key_on="feature.properties.STATE"`.  (This part looks a little bit magical, which is just a flaw in the design of the `datascience` library.  If it confuses you, don't worry too much.)
<!-- #endregion -->

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 5
Create a map of the US, with each state colored according to the proportion of undergraduates in that state who are Pell grant recipients, with higher-proportion states getting higher-intensity colors.

```{python for_assignment_type=student}
us_map = Map.read_geojson('us.json')
...
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 6
Describe any pattern you see in the data.  Be sure to mention any parts of the data that *don't* fit the pattern you describe.

## 3. Testing Dice



Students in a Data Science class want to figure out whether a six-sided die is fair or not. On a fair die, each face of the die appears with chance 1/6 on each roll, regardless of the results of other rolls.  Otherwise, a die is called unfair.  We can describe a die by the probability of landing on each face.  For example, this table describes a die that is unfairly weighted toward 1:

|Face|Probability|
|--|
|1|.5|
|2|.1|
|3|.1|
|4|.1|
|5|.1|
|6|.1|

For this exercise, you can use the function `proportion_from_distribution` defined in lecture and the textbook.  We've defined it in the setup cell above.


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 1
Define a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis for this question.

<!-- #region {"for_assignment_type": "student"} -->
**Null hypothesis:** ...

**Alternative hypothesis:** ...
<!-- #endregion -->

We decide to test the die by rolling it 5 times. The proportions of the 6 faces in these 5 rolls are stored in a table with 6 rows.  For example, here is the table we'd make if the die rolls ended up being 1, 2, 3, 3, and 5:

|Face|Proportion|
|--|
|1|.2|
|2|.2|
|3|.4|
|4|.0|
|5|.2|
|6|.0|

The function `mystery_test_statistic`, defined below, takes a single table like this as its argument and returns a number (which we will use as a test statistic).

```{python}
# Note: We've intentionally used obscurantist function and
# variable names to avoid giving away answers.  It's rarely
# a good idea to use names like "x" in your code.

def mystery_test_statistic(sample):
    x = sum(sample.column("Face")*sample.column("Proportion"))
    y = np.mean(np.arange(1, 6+1, 1))
    return abs(x - y)
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 2
Describe in English what the test statistic is.  Is it equivalent to the total variation distance between the observed face distribution and the fair die distribution?


*Write your answer here, replacing this text.*


The function `simulate_observations_and_test` takes as its argument a table describing the probability distribution of a die.  It simulates one set of 5 rolls of that die, then tests the null hypothesis about that die using our test statistic function above.  It returns `False` if it *rejects* the null hypothesis about the die, and `True` otherwise.

```{python}
# The probability distribution table for a fair die:
fair_die = Table().with_columns(
        "Face", np.arange(1, 6+1),
        "Probability", [1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6, 1/6])

def simulate_observations_and_test(actual_die):
    """Simulates die rolls from actual_die and tests the hypothesis that the die is fair.
    
    Returns True if that hypothesis is accepted, and False otherwise."""
    sample_size = 5
    p_value_cutoff = .2
    num_simulations = 250
    
    observation_set = proportions_from_distribution(actual_die, "Probability", sample_size)
    actual_statistic = mystery_test_statistic(observation_set.relabeled("Random Sample", "Proportion"))
    
    simulated_statistics = make_array()
    for _ in np.arange(num_simulations):
        one_observation_set_under_null = proportions_from_distribution(fair_die, "Probability", sample_size)
        simulated_statistic = mystery_test_statistic(one_observation_set_under_null.relabeled("Random Sample", "Proportion"))
        simulated_statistics = np.append(simulated_statistics, simulated_statistic)
    p_value = np.count_nonzero(actual_statistic < simulated_statistics) / num_simulations
    
    return p_value >= p_value_cutoff

# Calling the function to simulate a test of a fair die:
simulate_observations_and_test(fair_die)
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 3
By examining `simulate_observations_and_test`, compute the probability that it returns `False` when its argument is `fair_die` (which is defined above the function).  You can call the function a few times to see what it does, but **don't** perform a simulation to compute this probability.  Use your knowledge of hypothesis tests.

```{python}
probability_of_false = ...
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 4
From the perspective of someone who wants to know the truth about the die, is it good or bad for the function to return `False` when its argument is `fair_die`?


*Write your answer here, replacing this text.*


<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>
#### Question 5
Verify your answer to question 3 by simulation, computing an approximate probability that `simulation_observations_and_test` returns `False`.

**Note:** This will be a little slow.  300 repetitions of the simulation should suffice to get an answer that's roughly correct and should require a minute or so of computation.

```{python for_assignment_type=student}
num_test_simulations = 300

# For reference, the staff solution involved 6 lines of code before this.
...
approximate_probability_of_false = ...
approximate_probability_of_false
```

<div class="hide">\pagebreak</div>

```{python}
# For your convenience, you can run this cell to run all the tests at once!
import os
print("Running all tests...")
_ = [tests.grade(q[:-3]) for q in os.listdir("tests") if q.startswith('q')]
print("Finished running all tests.")
```
